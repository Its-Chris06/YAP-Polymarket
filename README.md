Polymarket UGC League: Monetizing the Global Truth Engine
"Empowering creators to turn their insights into influence and earnings within the world’s leading prediction ecosystem."

The Polymarket UGC League is a first-of-its-kind creator incubator designed to bridge the gap between niche expertise and viral content. By leveraging Polymarket’s massive data engine—where billions of dollars are traded on real-world outcomes—this program empowers a new generation of "Truth Tellers" to build personal brands while earning performance-based payouts ranging from $35 to $2,850 per post.

At its core, the UGC League is about Incentivized Insight. Whether you're tracking the 2026 World Cup, analyzing pop culture trends, or predicting financial shifts, the League provides the coaching, community, and capital to scale your voice. Built on the mission of democratizing information, the program turns every headline into a market and every creator into an analyst.
